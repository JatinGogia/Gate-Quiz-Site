        <h1>GATE</h1>
        <br>

        <p>The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive
            understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science for admission into the Masters
            Program Sector Companies.</p>
        <p> GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at
            Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National
            Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD),
            Government of India.</p>

        <p>The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for
            admissions to various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology,
            Master of Architecture, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial
            assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies.</p>

        <p>Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings for recruiting
            graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE
            is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in
            Singapore.[7]</p>
